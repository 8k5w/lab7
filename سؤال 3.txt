. To evaluate an expression in postfix notation using a nonrecursive approach, you can utilize a stack data structure. Here's a step-by-step algorithm:

1. Initialize an empty stack.
2. Read the expression from left to right, one token at a time.
3. If the token is an operand (number or variable), push it onto the stack.
4. If the token is an operator, pop the top two elements from the stack. Let's call them operand2 and operand1.
5. Perform the operation specified by the operator on operand1 and operand2.
6. Push the result of the operation back onto the stack.
7. Repeat steps 2 to 6 until all tokens in the expression have been processed.
8. Once all tokens have been processed, the result of the expression will be the value remaining on the stack. Pop it from the stack.
